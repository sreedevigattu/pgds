PCA is a dimensionality reduction (w/o losing information) technique achieved by finding a new set of basis vectors also known as principal components.
PCA is employed in 
- eliminate features
- EDA and data visualisation

PCA helps to
- Reduce the number of features. New features (less number) are created from the existing features. 
    - Out of these newly created features, features with less variance (= information) can be removed. 
- Reduce the multicolinearity between the features
