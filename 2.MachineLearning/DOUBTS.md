Evaluation metrics of models
- Classification models: When to use what?
    - Accuracy
    - confusion matrix
    - Sensitivity & Specificity Vs Precision & Recall
    - ROC
    - Classification Report
Which ones to use when?

- Understand classification report

- Comparison of all the models - LR, DT, RF, AdaBoost, GradBoost

here scaling & dummies is needed and where not?

| Algorithm | | 
|---|--- |
| Target Values |  | 
| Logistic Regression | |
| Decision Tree | No feature scaling is required here. Tree based models don't require scaling - they are invariant (that means they don't change if such a thing occurs) to monotonic transformations of any feature/input/independent variable. Non-parameteric model.  | 
| Random Forest |   No feature scaling is required | 
| AdaBoost |  |
| GradientBoost |  |

Why is logistic regression called "regression" if it doesn't model continuous outcomes?
